			<h3>Brief Desc</h3>
			<p> Lee Lee is like a part of my life, I was hired to work here as a cashier when I was 16 years. Somehow, I earned the owner interested 
				and I kept being promoted from team-leader to general manager. However, my life changed after I learned the existing of code. While, 
				I worked for them as general manager, I managed learn from their retail system and use to improve my experiences. This is where Lee Lee product
				management project was invented.
				The project started as an experiment, but due to the robust and customaizeable of self-managed application, it provided the value to my 
				employer. Thus, the I was able to convinvced to switch the product managament application to this project.
				It have been evolved ever since the genesis initiatetion, the project is still being maintain by me until now.
